This script lists all cities from the database `hbtn_0e_4_usa` along with their
corresponding state names. The results are sorted by the city ID in ascending
order.

    database_name: The name of the database to query (`hbtn_0e_4_usa`).

Requirements:
    - Only the MySQLdb module is allowed.
    - The script connects to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306.
    - The script must use only one call to the execute() method.
